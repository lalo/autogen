This GAIA submission represents an initial (i.e., very early) multi-agent experiment, where we are testing our benchmarking tools ([AutoGenBench](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/blog/2024/01/25/AutoGenBench/)), and some experimental ideas on orchestration. Specifically, facts and “educated guesses” are tracked in a common ledger, and agents restart when they detect that they are not making progress. See scenario.py and orchestrator.py for full details.
